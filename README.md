# kaggle-tpu-lab

Run open models on Kaggle's free TPU v5e-8 and get a public endpoint that speaks the
OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. Point Claude Code, Codex CLI, opencode or anything else at it.
No GPU, no cloud bill, about twenty minutes from pressing Run to a URL.

> This fork tracks [ARahim3/kaggle-tpu-lab](https://github.com/ARahim3/kaggle-tpu-lab)
> and adds a native Windows desktop companion. The upstream model recipes, datasets
> and benchmark results remain credited to the upstream project.

Each model has its own folder with a run-all Kaggle notebook, the kernel script behind
it, and a write-up of how it works and what we measured.

| Model | Weights on the TPU | Context | One stream | Many streams | Prefill | Run → URL | Engine | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Qwen3.8-27B](qwen38-27b/) | bf16, no quantization | 262k | ~130 tok/s | ~540 tok/s at 8 | 10,300 tok/s | ~22 min | vllm-tpu + one patch | [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rahim3/qwen3-8-27b-bf16-on-kaggle-tpu-130-tok-s-api) |
| [GLM-5.3-Flash](glm53-flash/) (320B MoE) | 3-bit experts, int8 rest | 262k | ~64 tok/s | ~90 tok/s at 3 | ~1,600 tok/s | ~16 min | our own JAX engine | [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rahim3/glm-5-3-flash-on-a-free-kaggle-tpu-64-tok-s-api) |

Numbers are measured on the shipped configuration; the folder READMEs say how. Qwen runs on
vllm-tpu with one patch. GLM-5.3-Flash runs on an engine we wrote in JAX for it; as far as we
know it is the first to run that model on a TPU. (Qwen's throughput table is
0.28.0-era and stale since the 0.29.0 re-baseline — re-measurement on a live
TPU is pending; see `qwen38-27b/README.md`.)

## What you need

A Kaggle account with TPU access (phone-verify it under Settings) and its free quota,
around 20 TPU hours a week. Nothing to install for the notebook route. For the terminal
route, Python 3.9+ and the Kaggle CLI.

## How a session works

The notebook attaches public datasets holding the weights (and, where it helps, a
pre-built compile cache), builds the engine across the eight chips, opens a Cloudflare
tunnel and prints the URL and an API key. The last cell is the server: leave it running.
A keepalive holds the session up to Kaggle's limit, a little under nine hours, after
which you run it again and get a new URL.

Wire a coding agent with one line, for example Claude Code:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<url> ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<key> ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<model> claude
```

Each folder README has the exact lines for Claude Code, Codex CLI and opencode.

## From a terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k0valik/kaggle-tpu-lab
cd kaggle-tpu-lab
python launch.py serve                       # Qwen3.8-27B
python launch.py serve --model glm53-flash   # GLM-5.3-Flash
python launch.py build-weights --hf-model-id OWNER/QUANT  # mirror any HF checkpoint via a free CPU kernel (Qwen)
```

`launch.py` pushes the kernel with the Kaggle CLI and follows its progress; `status`
and `stop` do what they say. `build-weights` burns no TPU time: it downloads on a
free CPU kernel so you can make a weights dataset for the TPU run.

## Desktop companion (Windows)

This fork includes a Tauri 2 + Rust + React/TypeScript tray app in `src-tauri/` and
`src/`. It reuses the root `launch.py`, follows Kaggle + ntfy state, probes the live
endpoint, and exposes start/stop/settings from the tray UI.

The companion manages both **Qwen3.8-27B** and **GLM-5.3-Flash**. Each model has its own
persisted launch profile: Qwen exposes its context/MTP/fast-start/async-scheduling knobs,
while GLM exposes context/streams/reasoning and uses the launcher's serve-dataset default.
The active model is stored in the launcher state file, so re-attaching never mistakes one
model's endpoint for the other. Qwen publishes an OpenAI `/v1` base directly; GLM publishes
the tunnel root, and the companion normalizes it to the same OpenAI-compatible base URL.
When the endpoint is live, the Companion exposes a harness-agnostic Connect card for copying
the normalized base URL, API key, served model name, or a ready-to-paste environment setup.

For the desktop app, keep this repository checkout and its `.venv` available on the
machine; the app invokes that Python environment and `launch.py` rather than bundling a
second copy of the Kaggle launcher.

## Adding a model

One folder at the top level, named after the model: `README.md` with the numbers and the
how, `kernel/` with the serving script, `notebook/` with the run-all notebook generated
from it, plus whatever the recipe needs (a patch, an engine). The launcher and the
notebook share the same config block, so a setting changed in one place means the same
thing in the other.

## License

The code here is MIT. Model weights keep their own licenses; each folder says which.
